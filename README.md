# Data-Cleaning-for-Student-Scores-Problem
Real-world data is often messy, with missing values, incorrect entries, and duplicates. This makes analysis unreliable and can lead to wrong conclusions.

Solution
I cleaned a student dataset by correcting missing ages, invalid scores, and standardizing data types, and removing duplicates, so the data could be analyzed correctly.

Tools
Python, pandas, Google Sheets, CSV dataset

Results
The cleaned dataset had valid ages and scores within a realistic range, no duplicates, and was ready for accurate analysis and visualization.

Learning
I learned that data quality matters more than model complexity, and even small errors in data can significantly alter the results.
